*** USE SVN PLEASE ***

To those who wanna join MCF:

我们欢迎加入者，但是这里我想强调一点，** 这里不欢迎 git 用户。**
We give our warm welcome to those who aspire to join in the development of MCF.
But here I have to emphasize it again: ** Git users are NOT welcomed here. **

有人会问，既然不准用 git 你为什么把这些东西放在 github 上呢？
Someone may ask, "Why did you put your stuffs on github rather than anywhere else such as Google Code?"

因为 github 真是太他妈的好用了，但是显然这和 git 没什么关系。
I will answer, "Because github is the f*cking best free project hosting engine among those I have ever seen.
However that is NOT and will NEVER be the evidence of git's ease to use because github is NOT git."

Git is GAAAAAAAARBAGE. Git F*CKs.
